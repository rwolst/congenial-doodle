# Fractals
An attempt to make the fractal image described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6r4rb4/a_julia_set_fractal_with_python/).

To run the program, the defaults should work nicely:

    python3 julia.py

To get more information about the values that can be changed:

    python3 julia.py --help
